;; # Year 2023; Day 12

;; Here we need to generate various combinations of a string, where '?' can represent either a dot or hash symbol.
;; The combinations need to match a particular sequence of hash-symbols separated by dots, given by the numbers
;; to the right in the data set. So for example, in the first line, the minimum matching string is "#.#.###"
;; (given the numbers 1, 1 and 3).

(def test-data "???.### 1,1,3
.??..??...?##. 1,1,3
?#?#?#?#?#?#?#? 1,3,1,6
????.#...#... 4,1,1
????.######..#####. 1,6,5
?###???????? 3,2,1")

;; This function splits a line, generates a regex-pattern from the right hand part (numbers), and a list of
;; combinations from the right hand part. Then we find the list of combinations that match the pattern:

(defn split-line
  ([line] (split-line 1 line))
  ([scale line]
   (let [[pattern numbers] (String/.split line " ")]
     [(map parse-long (re-seq #"\d+" (String/join "," ^Collection (repeat scale numbers))))
      (String/.replaceAll
        (String/join "?" ^Collection (repeat scale pattern))
        "\\.\\.+" ".")])))

(split-line (second (str/split-lines test-data)))
